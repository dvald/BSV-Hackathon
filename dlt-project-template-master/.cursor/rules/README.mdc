# Cursor Rules for DLT Project

This directory contains development rules for Cursor IDE.
## Language Policy

- **Response Language:** Always respond in the same language the user asks the question
- **Documentation Language:** If user asks in Spanish for documentation in English, provide it in English as requested
- **Code Consistency:** Code comments should be in English to maintain consistency across the project

## File Structure

- **`general.mdc`** - General project rules that apply to all code
- **`config.mdc`** - Specific rules for configuration files
- **`controllers.mdc`** - Rules for API controllers with JSDoc/Swagger documentation
- **`models.mdc`** - Rules for data models using tsbean-orm
- **`services.mdc`** - Rules for the domain services layer
- **`utils.mdc`** - Rules for utility modules

## How to Use

Cursor IDE will automatically detect and apply these rules based on the file patterns defined in each rules file. The rules are organized by:

1. **Applicable file patterns** - Each rules file specifies which files it covers
2. **Naming conventions** - Standards for class, function, and variable names
3. **Code structures** - Required architectural patterns (e.g., Singleton for services)
4. **Validation and error handling** - How to handle errors and validate inputs
5. **Required documentation** - JSDoc and other necessary comments
6. **PR checklist** - Items to verify before creating pull requests

## Migration from Copilot

These rules have been converted from the original GitHub Copilot instructions while maintaining:

- ✅ All existing code conventions
- ✅ Established architectural patterns
- ✅ JSDoc documentation requirements for API generation
- ✅ Security and error handling standards
- ✅ Git workflow and commit policies

## Key Features

### 🎯 **File Type Specific Focus**
Each file type (config, controllers, models, services, utils) has specific rules that apply automatically.

### 🔒 **Security by Default**
- No logging of secrets or PII
- Early input validation
- Centralized error handling

### 📚 **Automatic Documentation**
- JSDoc required for APIs
- Automatic client binding generation
- Structured comments for databases

### 🏗️ **Consistent Architecture**
- Singleton pattern for services and configurations
- Clear separation between layers (controller → service → model)
- Strict typing in TypeScript

### 🌐 **Language Flexibility**
- Always respond in the user's preferred language
- Support for documentation in requested language
- Naming conventions that preserve technical terms

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Uniform code across the entire project
2. **Quality** - Prevention of common errors through automatic rules
3. **Productivity** - Contextual suggestions based on file type
4. **Maintainability** - Established patterns facilitate maintenance
5. **Collaboration** - Clear standards for the entire team

## Getting Started

Once Cursor IDE is configured with these rules, the editor will automatically:

- Suggest appropriate patterns for each file type
- Validate that naming conventions are followed
- Remind you to add required JSDoc documentation
- Apply security and error handling best practices
